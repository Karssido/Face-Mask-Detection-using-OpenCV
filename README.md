## INTRODUCTION
Usage of facemask has been increasing day by day due to the COVID 19 pandemic. It is necessary to teach people to wear mask to COVID to rise. However, it is also difficult to control people in over-populated country like us. For this reason, we can use facemask detection modelusing the security camera in the public places and control people remotely. In this report, we have developed a facemask detector using python codes and artificial intelligence. Nowadays, AI is being used in almost every sector. Smart problem needs smart solutions. AI helps people to reduce human effort and time. AI can be created by training the machine. To train the machine, multiple machine language or programming language can be used because machine cannot understand 
human language. So that machine needs to be trained using the 
programming language tools. As previously mentioned, we have used 
Python to train our model. To train the model, several packages of 
python were needed. Also, after training the model, we have created a 
video streaming model to detect faces. These processes will be discussed 
in depth in this report
